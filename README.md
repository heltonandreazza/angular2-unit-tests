## Further Resources & Where to Go Next

This Module only provides a brief and basic Introduction to Angular 2 Unit Tests and the Angular 2 Testing Suite. This Course isn't focused on Testing.

If you want to dive deeper, the official Docs actually are a great place to start. There you'll also find a Non-CLI Setup!
